        As a tech professional with over 4+ years ranging from having experience
        as a support application analyst to being a
        <span className="developer"> software developer</span>, I have
        cultivated an impressive skill set from strong debugging skills to even
        photoshop and figma skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned to utilize cutting-edge development and techniques
        through the use of React, Next JS, HTML, CSS/SASS,
        Javascript/Typescript. These technical skills allow me to create
        beautiful, dynamic, and responsive websites while writing clean code
        that is reusable. I thrive in collaborative environments with
        cross-functional teams from designers to software engineers to managers.
